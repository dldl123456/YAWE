YAWE
====
YAWE (Yet Another WoW Emulator) has been discontinued mid-2007.

Originally developed using these principles:
* Delphi based MMORPG server that aims to provide fast and clean OOP code. 
* We achieve speed by combining Win32 API, assembler code (MMX/SSE/SSE2) and Multi-Core based systems. 
* All code is Delphi 10 and later compatible.
